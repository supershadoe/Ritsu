## Note
Do not try to invite this bot right now as it is in a very alpha stage and also declares guild commands by default.

## Features
- Fetching the details of a compound from PubChem using their PUG API
- Nothing else rn ðŸ˜…

## FAQ
### Why aren't you using a RESTBot?
Because I can't host an HTTP server.
### Will there be more features coming up?
Yeah, but not soon. Can't promise when or what.
### Why is the code Python (>=3.10)?
That's because I use Arch, and it's just simpler for me to use that.
And also because, I wanted to try those new stuff like match-case.
